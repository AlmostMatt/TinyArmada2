draw a line from click down to current

groups follow path while it is being drawn and paths to stop when it hits a wall

remove persistent hover

singleton groups?
	or subset groups in general
		if a selection starts and ends inside a unit group, select the subset
		if the selection leaves the group, it is a path to be followed
		
			this is a bit awkward, actually	
	should new units be singleton groups?
	should singletons have group indicators/hotkeys?

group 'colors' and overlay buttons for each color - overlay button moves camera to the group
	try to reuse colors in case a group is accidentally disbanded/merged
		(of hover, take most common colorID that will be available and reuse)
		
obstacle avoidance, "flocking", queueing

HUD:
	selection abilities / trainable units / warpin
	selection group buttons
	minimap
	scrolling
	health bars

Camera movement

buildings
	dynamic navmesh - excluding buildings/walls?
	(unity has some 3d navmesh code)

unit AI / autocast abilities for combat (some auto positioning too, if left idle)


possibilities:
	2 finger tap to select (a circle)
		have selection circle fade over a few seconds
	2 finger pinch to zoom
	2 finger drag to pan
	1 finger drag to zoom
	1 finger drag to select
	1 finger drag from a group to instruct
	tap to select a group
	tap to form singleton
	tap to move selection
	tap to recenter camera
	drag from building for commands
	tap and hold to set unit group, tap to select, double tap to go to
	on screen buttons:
		info, center cam
	edge of screen arrows (to units / groups)
	
	I think I like the idea of the last used group being selected and tap to move
	with an alternative shorthand of drag to move an unselected or drag to select or 2f tap to select

squad behaviour:
	attack move forward, flee backward
	autokite as ranged vs melee
	auto spread (line shape) when fighting
	back up low health units if ranged
	prioritize low health units (focus fire)

actionMap to return an ID when you add an action rather than taking it as an arg.
	ArrayList
	
Units : face target when shooting, don't change facing direction (or move) during 'animation' duration

todo: pseudo turnrate (if ! animating, turnToward)
	setAngle on shoot

IDENTICAL dists -> a bug
unit - neighbours is currently N N log N efficiency (N^2 to make the assoc, and N log N to sort each of the N lists)

HP arcs
	old builtin shader

	have thicker arc in the alpha image
	
	higher res + power of 2

update animation durations lookAt to look at moving objects or fixed points instead of fixed durations

figure out how to organize ability/statuses
