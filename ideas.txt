tiny armada:

tap on a settlement to start/stop trading with it

can still use gestures for more precise controls, overrides, or military units

can have 2 ships trading with 3 cities or 3 ships with 1 city, ships have expected arrival times and try to maximize your income
    increase in profit / travel time where increase in profit is
        (expected gold city will have when this ship arrives
            + expected gold when next ship arrives
            - expected gold when next ship arrives if this ship hadn't arrived) if there is another ship that will arrive later
                    (don't want ships to prioritize racing each other)
        alternatively the closer ship can take the city, and the further ship can re-evaluate
                    
control similar to the mine: set destiations, autonomous workers

During combat, gestures to split and move fleets, tap targets for priotization

also mark areas as safe/dangerous for trade ships, so they can prefer the long route and take the route into account with respect to profit

        http://extra-credits.net/episodes/aesthetics-of-play/
    growth:
        building more stuff (construct buildings, colonize islands)
    strategy
    combat
    expression ? (if you can customize your fleet or something)
    sensory: visually pretty
    abnegation (fun to watch stuff happen during lulls in action)
    combative
    
    out of game:
        collection 
        
    if multiplayer:
        recognition (ranking)
        skill
        competitive
            could even do mobile multiplayer if the actions are not generally immediate.

    watching boats trade
     

buildings:
    regen
    tower
    trading
    looting (steal from other players, destroy neutral cities)

    dock for repairs?
    shipyard - constructs ships
    colony - people build settlements -> source of food/wood/coin/stone

ships:
        health
        speed
        can fish
        cargo capacity
        attack type/range/damage - bonuses vs buildings
    siege ships (slow mspeed + aspeed, long range)
    fishing
        provides food, aoe2 fish camps or moving schools of fish (maybe fish patrol an area)
    colony ship -> creates colonies
    

controls/input:
    web/mobile (unity)
    play like 'the mine'
    
    - tap colonies to go to and target them
    - tap enemy ships to attack / chase them
    - gesture movement for drive by / ships naturally flee when outnumbered or if they have no instruction
        
game mechanics:
    no fog
    small world (1 screen on pc, 2x2 on mobile)
    2-4 players
        ai players that have different mechanics/playstyle than humans (pirates, random harass)
        reward for eliminating ai (gold, resoruces)
    
    ship building / construction / expansion as wheel / buttons near existing buildings
        (main base has a defensive turret and a repair dock)
    
    traders autoflee (pathing to avoid enemies)
    
    'trading' ships patrol for income
        different colonies provide different resource types
        (varying density / profit)
        large cities generate gold faster
    'vikings' loot for resources + sabotage enemies trade
    'raiding' attempts to move quickly and sink traders
    
    early building defenses mitigate rush strats, but raiding workers is effective
    motivation to trade with distant colonies prevents turtle strategies -> promotes interaction
        (sc 1-2 base minerals suck, aoe trees and farms suck, earlygame bush gold exploration and aoe3 hero exploration both cool)
    capturing colonies is similar to spreading creep
    
    flow of the game:
        20s of planning
        build some ships
        tap some colonies to trade with (prioritize food)
        build more traders and a light raiding ship
        
        capture some buildings for repairs/defense and harass enemy traders
            (making a lot of defenses is no fun, aggressive defenses are delicate to balance)
        change resource priority -> buy tech / upgrades at colony
        build larger military
        take some outer colonies by brute force.
        if standoff, threaten raids
        use military to get better economy
        tech further
        build siege ship
        begin slow-push into enemy's base
        all-out fight

visuals:
    ideally don't need trees
        but if I use trees, prerender them
    split hull, sail, and image colors to separate objects for Z sorting
    visualize trade routes
    only water is really boring
    ice + ice breakers -> drifting and cracked sheets of ice look really cool
        (can be a game mechanic or just visual -> slow the first time you pass through)
    
    boats are made of wood and have oars. sails are optional. longboats are cool.

    fish jump out of water
    aoe3 boats looked really cool but the game wasn't designed around naval combat
    ships loaded with gold
    fire after taking damage
    floating debris from destroyed ships
    mast/sail fall off of ships
    
    recoil and smoke from cannons
    volleys of arrows from raiders
    ripples / white water trails
    animated oars -> more ripples / dynamic turning
    
    
    
    
    navmesh / pathing
    
        HEIRARCHICAL PATHFINDING
            http://aigamedev.com/open/review/near-optimal-hierarchical-pathfinding/
            (nodes are computed and cost to travel between nodes is also precomputed)
            then total path is pathing done on the large graph + small amount of extra pathing

    update pathing every N frames on frame k mod n
    buildings have a 'dock' that is on water so that it is reachable, (or two docks)
    
    generate mesh for map (plane with texture coordinates)
            --
            TRIANGLES (hexagons)
            then if an entire hex is land, I can have different triangle textures based on what the adjacent hexes are
            (this could work with squares too. -> 4 triangles)
            would still need a lot of transition tiles
        distort some coordinates to make shapes interesting, figure out navmesh similarly.
